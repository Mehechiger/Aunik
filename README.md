## Aunik
(A)LL YO(U) (N)EED (I)S (K)EYBOARD is a whole efficient environmental setup on macOS implemented with Karabiner Elements complex modifications and Hammerspoon lua scripts. It combines my code and a (deep) mod of jasonrudolph/keyboard and wingillis/hammerspoon-vim-bindings.

## TODO
- this repo is currently under construction, more detailled specs await.
